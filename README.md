Multi Fidelity Surrogate Modeling

This code seeks to compare the data compression, accuracy, portability, and evaluation time for two different types of surrogate modeling techniques: Kriging and Deep Neural Nets (DNN). First, we will build single fidelity models based on the RANS data (our high fidelity data set), then we will build single fidelity models based on local methods (low fidelity data set). Finally, we will build multi-fidelity models combining the data from both models. Our goal is to beat the performance of the single fidelity model, and also potentially explore how much of the high fidelity data is needed--maybe we can match the performace of the single fidelity model, but with significantly less data.
